        <h1>The American Black Bear</h1>

        <p class="information">
            The American black bear (Ursus americanus), also known as the black bear
            , is a species of medium-sized bear endemic to North America. It is the
             continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. The
              American black bear is an omnivore, with a diet varying greatly
               depending on season and location. It typically lives in largely 
               forested areas but will leave forests in search of food and is sometimes
                attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food.

            The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the American black
             bear as a least-concern species because of its widespread distribution and a large
              population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. Along
               with the brown bear (Ursus arctos), it is one of only two modern bear species not
                considered by the IUCN to be globally threatened with extinction.
