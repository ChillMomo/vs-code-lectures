    <h1>The Andean Bear</h1>

    <p class="information">
        Most scientists refer to spectacled bears as Andean bears (they are
        found only in the Andes mountains in South America). The bears are
         an endangered species, listed as Vulnerable, and it is illegal to
           kill them. The Andean bear is the last remaining short-faced bear
            (subfamily Tremarctinae) and the closest living relative to the 
            Florida spectacled bear and short-faced bears of the Middle
             Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene age. Spectacled bears are the
              only surviving species of bear native to South America, and the
               only surviving member of the subfamily Tremarctinae. The
                Spectacled Bear is technically the largest land carnivore on
                 that continent, although as little as 5% of its diet is
                  composed of meat. South America’s largest obligate carnivore
                   is the jaguar. Among South America’s extant, native land animals,
                    only the Baird’s and South American Tapirs are heavier than
                     this species. The Spectacled bear is a mid-sized species 
                     of bear. Overall its fur is blackish in color, though bears
                      may vary from jet black to dark brown and to even a reddish
                       hue. The species typically has distinctive beige-coloured
                        marking across its face and upper chest, though not all
                         Spectacled bears have “spectacle” markings. The pattern
                          and extent of pale markings are slightly different on
                           each individual bear and bears can be readily distinguished
                            by this. Males are a third larger than females in
                             dimensions and sometimes twice their weight. Males 
                             can weigh 100 – 200 kilograms (220 – 440 lb), and
                              females 35 –82 kilograms (77 – 181 lb). Length can 
                              range from 120 to 200 cm (47–79 in), with a tail 
                              length of a mere 7 cm (2.8 in), and shoulder height 
                              from 60 to 90 cm (24–30 in). Compared to other living 
                              bears, this species has a more rounded face with a 
                              relatively short and broad snout. In some extinct 
                              species of the Tremarctinae subfamily, this facial
                               structure has been thought to be an adaptation 
                               to a largely carnivorous diet, despite the modern 
                               Spectacled bears’ herbivorous dietary preferences.
