        <h1>The Polar Bear</h1>

        <p class="information">
            The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and
             nearby areas. It is closely related to the brown bear, and the two species
              can interbreed. The polar bear is the largest extant species of bear and
               land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). The 
               species is sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. The 
               polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin and a thick 
               layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower 
               skull, longer neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more
                adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow the bear to walk on 
                ice and paddle in the water.
